###Till now worked on Cartpole v2 game 

In this Cartpole game which i choose as the environment for my OpenAI gym toolkit, has a main goal to keep the hammer in straight in upwards vertical direction for maximum possible time. In this program we will train our bot to play according to two possible scenarios, either the hammer will fall left or it will fall right. At first we will make our agent to play randomly and reward it according to the position of hammer and for how much time the hammer has been held straight, our agent or bot will learn from the observation recorded in previous iterations and apply those learning to keep the hammer in vertical position in the next game round. The better our bot works more will be the reward. So our bot try to maximize the reward.

I will implement the same techniques in the games like Star craft 2 and GTA 5 which has way more inputs and output variables.
